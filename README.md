# 🏠 Tom's Lab Space | homelab adventures

> **A self-built, production-grade purple-team home lab** — designed for hands-on cybersecurity learning, attack simulation, and defensive tool testing. Everything here is documented as I build it.

---

## Purpose

This repo is the living documentation of my home lab. Every major build step, configuration decision, lesson learned, and "why did that break" moment gets written up here. The goal is twofold:

1. **Force myself to understand things deeply enough to explain them**
2. **Build a portfolio that shows real hands-on work, not just certifications**
3. **Create a valuable resource for others taking the plunge into cybersecurity and/or self-hosting**

The lab is intentionally purple-team: I use it to run attacks, observe what they look like in logs and SIEM alerts, refine detection rules, and harden defenses. Break it, fix it, document it, repeat.

##  Key Things I've Learned

- **Bro, DNS really is everything.** When something breaks mysteriously, it's almost always DNS. The t-shirts are true. Building a redundant DNS cluster taught me more about how the protocol actually works than any course.
- **VirtioFS passthrough** requires specific kernel support — learned this the hard way after a kernel update broke mounts silently. Wanted to **fstab** something. 🔪 ...But I got it!
- **Tailscale ACLs** are deceptively powerful. Treating access by identity rather than IP flipped how I think about network segmentation. Really feels like it could be the enterprise standard soon. 
- **SIEM alerting is an art.** Too broad = alert fatigue. Too narrow = blind spots. Tuning Splunk against my own lab attacks has been the most valuable hands-on security learning I've done. Pairing it with Wireshark and port mapping/sniffing tools, plus applying things I've learned from online hacking labs has been super rewarding!
- **Caddy is underrated.** Compared to nginx or Apache for a homelab reverse proxy, the automatic TLS handling alone saves so much time and so many headaches.

<sub>This repo is actively maintained. Configs, writeups, and lessons learned are added as I build. Nothing here is aspirational — if it's documented, it's been **built** and **tested**. Anytime there's a disaster you can expect a postmortum here where I pick through the rubble.</sub>
